    <p>Hello to whoever reading this, we really want to share the story of how everything started creating our own shop. First of all we never thought of opening a shop of this type but it all started when our first child was born and we just wanted all our memories and pictures of her everywhere and that is when everything started when we so badly wanted our phone case with her pictures and ordered it straight away, that is also when our moment was ruined as unfortunately the seller never shipped the order because for sure as my phone was just released he did not have the case in stock but still kept it listed with the idea to keep us waiting. That is when we came with the idea thinking how much room is there for improvement by perfectioning the personalised phone cases and here we are today, where we are very proud to say that our phone cases, mugs, tumblers and many many things in our house hold pictures of our memories and that is all done by us. As much as we loved our personalised things when they were done, we also love our job of customising things for all our customers. Any design, any idea, any product drop us a message we will do it for you, or even if you want to do your owns drop us a message we are here to help.

Ps. We have a high range of customising machines, not only including what you see listed, but can do also laser engraving and sublimation in same product so don't hesitate to contact us with any request!</p>
